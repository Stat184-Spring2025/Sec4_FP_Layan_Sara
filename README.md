# Exploring Factors Influencing Movie Success

This repository includes the datasets, code, and visualizations for our STAT 184 final project, where we explored various factors that influence a movie’s success using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project examined elements such as genres, stars, and production companies, and through our analysis, we discovered several interesting patterns and results.


## Overview

Building on that analysis, the goal of our project was to uncover deeper insights into what drives both critical and financial success in the film industry. We focused on identifying measurable patterns across different dimensions of movie data, guided by three key research questions:

1) How do audience ratings compare across the five most common movie genres?

2) Which top studios have the best return on investment, and is there a relationship between movie budget and profit?

3) Which stars appear most frequently in successful movies, and does the presence of specific stars tend to be linked to higher movie success?

By exploring these questions, we aimed to better understand how different attributes, such as creative decisions, casting, and production investment, shape a film’s performance. This project offers a data-driven perspective for anyone interested in the intersection of storytelling, business strategy, and audience response within the movie industry.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure

Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Be sure to list where you got any data used within the project. Be sure to acknowledge any one whose work or elements you're drawing upon.

## Authors

Give information about who are the authors of the project and how people can get in touch if they have questions.
