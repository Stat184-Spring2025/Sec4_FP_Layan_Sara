# Exploring Factors Influencing Movie Success

This repository includes the datasets, code, and visualizations for our STAT 184 final project, where we explored various factors that influence a movieâ€™s success using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project examined elements such as genres, stars, and production companies, and through our analysis, we discovered several interesting patterns and results.


## Overview

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure

Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Be sure to list where you got any data used within the project. Be sure to acknowledge any one whose work or elements you're drawing upon.

## Authors

Give information about who are the authors of the project and how people can get in touch if they have questions.
