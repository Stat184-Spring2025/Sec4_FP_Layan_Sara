Goal:â€¨Create visualizations to explore our hypothesis and answer some research questions:
- Do movies with higher budgets tend to generate higher worldwide gross earnings?
- Are certain genres associated with higher average ratings?
- Do some directors consistently have higher IMDB ratings than others? Which directors have the most movies in the Top 250 list?
- Is there a trend between movie release year and IMDB rating?

Needs:
We will need the datasets,functions to read datasets, different R packages, wrangling and tidying verbs, ggplot and kable
functions to visualize, piping operations

Steps:
1.  Install and load the data
2.  View the data and inspect if tidy or not
3.  Clean data 
    1. Remove unnecessary rows/columns
    2. Rename columns
    3. Remove NA values 
4. Join/Merge the two datasets through a common column (movie names)
5. Analyse the merged dataset
    1. Create summary or frequency tables
    2. Style and showcase the tables
    3. Look out for cases that might not make sense 
6. Create the visualizations
    1. Scatter plot, Line chart, Histogram, etc
    2. Label axes, title and legend 
    3. Customize the graphs and make them accessible
7. Debugging and improving code
8. Describe the trends and patterns in narrative texts
9. Create a QMD report for the findings then render to a PDF
10. Cite the sources 
11. Code Appendix
